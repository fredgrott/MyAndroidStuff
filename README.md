# MyAndroidStuff
You are a cofounder of a funded startup tasked with finding an android developer. The only two things that you have to differentiate your startup from competitors is making the android app responsive AND putting HUMAN KINDNESS both in the development process and design process.

I am seeking that rare startup that desires both and is willing to take a very small risk to get both.
In these appsamples you will see CS and Design applied to the problem of reponsive app development and design of human UX experience.

## Why

Why should you hire a top 11% android dev stackoveflow developer

Simple, I have the combination of Both Customer-Appreciation-Vision and 
Deep Android App Architecture edge pushing that you are seeking. In 
my current android app sampels I am pushing the Fluxaan which 
is a combination of Flux borrowed from Facebook react and Redux which 
results in a more stable and responsive app compared to the 
default android app arhcitecture styles that Google 
encourages.

## What Senior Android Dev Looks Like?

The things you should see in app-code samples for a Senior Android Developer cover these areas:

* Choice and or creation of App Architecture to Produce a Responsive Mobile App
* Customize and or backporting UI widgets to create the user experience
* Adherence to a UI Design framework
* Decoupling, not only the app components but decoupling it from also the backend

If you cannot find these features in my app code samples, than obviously you as a startup cofounder need to seek someone else. I was a startup founder once, I know what you gals and guys want in a devloper and wnat you 200 percent looking awesome.
