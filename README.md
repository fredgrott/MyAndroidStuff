Simple, I have the combination of Both Customer-Appreciation-Vision and 
Deep Android App Architecture edge pushing that you are seeking. In 
my current android app sampels I am pushing the Fluxaan which 
is a combination of Flux borrowed from Facebook react and Redux which 
results in a more stable and responsive app compared to the 
default android app arhcitecture styles that Google 
encourages.

## What Senior Android Dev Looks Like?

The things you should see in app-code samples for a Senior Android Developer cover these areas:

* Choice and or creation of App Architecture to Produce a Responsive Mobile App
* Customize and or backporting UI widgets to create the user experience
* Adherence to a UI Design framework
* Decoupling, not only the app components but decoupling it from also the backend

If you cannot find these features in my app code samples, than obviously you as a startup cofounder need to seek someone else. I was a startup founder once, I know what you gals and guys want in a devloper and wnat you 200 percent looking awesome.
