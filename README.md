## Why

Why should you hire a top 11% android dev stackoveflow developer

instead of the candidate you have before you?

Simple, I have the combination of Both Customer-Appreciation-Vision and 
Deep Android App Architecture edge pushing that you are seeking. In 
my current android app sampels I am pushing the Fluxaan which 
is a combination of Flux borrowed from Facebook react and Redux which 
results in a more stable and responsive app compared to the 
default android app arhcitecture styles that Google 
encourages.
