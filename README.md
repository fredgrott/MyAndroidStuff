# MyAndroidStuff

Let's be blunt. You as the startup cofounder need to find a Senior Android Dev like yesterday and 
no one with a Senior Android Dev title will horizontially move to your 100k postion at your startup.
Have you thought about looking for those Android Devs who are currently praticing AndroidDevOps 
standards, for example:

[KTDevOps](https://github.com/shareme/KTDevOps)

The real secret to Material Design App conversions is having a DevOps system to push out new app 
features on a regular basis to than re-use in assisting app users to rave about it on social platforms.  Yes, the visual Material Design effects are important but you need that 2nd part of the 
one-to-two punch namely regular new feature updates via a well setup DevOps strategy.

AND, integrating my dev processes with YOUR STARTUP's MARKETING push is in fact Senior level Engineer.
